## **Note** - This is a simplified, general version of the code I wrote for the actual project - which is proporietary and on Qualcomm servers. I have shared as much as I could without violating CCI constraints. 

# Graph Diffusion Model
This repository demonstrates a diffusion-based approach to denoise noisy graph data using synthetic examples. The project includes graph generation, a denoising model, and evaluation pipelines.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Code for generating synthetic graphs.
- `src/`: Core model, training, and evaluation scripts.
- `utils/`: Helper functions for graph visualization and processing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for demos and experiments.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shristy2404/graph-diffusion-model.git
   cd graph-diffusion-model
